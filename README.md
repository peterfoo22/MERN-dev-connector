# MERN-dev-connector


This was a UDEMY Full Stack MERN project.  Building Back End First and Front End first.  This project took me over 180 hours to complete as there was were many adjustments and bugs that needed to be fixed along the way (Thats Programming!).  

We built a Social Connector for Developers with all api routes, and using React for the front end.  The social developer connector allows for creation of profile, add experience and education, and see other posts, make comments and posts to the site.    

Tech Stack for this Project:

Mongo DB
Express
Node.js
React
